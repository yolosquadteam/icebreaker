## Project Description (Brief):

This game will serve as the initial project of this group. The scale will need to be kept very reasonable to allow all members to make contributions. It will serve as a learning exercise in the realm of project management and modular programming. Games of any reasonable size require a significant amount of planning, and we can use this opportunity to get a handle on the design patterns that are used frequently in the industry.

In line with the idea of learning modular programming, many outside libraries and tools may be sourced. At this point, Pygame will definitely be used, but we may look towards other tools that have better GUI support. Using outside libraries will exercise all member’s ability to read and make sense of professional level API documentation.
